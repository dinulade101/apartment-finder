# Apartment Finder

## What is this?
Apartment Finder is a python bot that scrapes Kijiji.com in order to find apartments within a certain price range. 

---
## Implementation
We used Firebase Realtime Database to store users' profiles, with every user getting 2 distinct keys: one for their social profile and one for their business profile. For this, we used [AngularFire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2) to set up every user with 2 different, distinct keys, to store their social data.


For data exchange, we used the [NFC library](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/nfc/) for Ionic .


We used TypeScript and CSS to build the app's layout.
